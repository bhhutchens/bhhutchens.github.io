          In asking questions online, it's important to remember there are characteristics that make up a good question, and there are characteristics that make up a bad question. Good questions get answered, while bad questions do not get answered or cannot be answered. This post will cover some good characteristics I have encountered, as well as some bad.

          Good questions have some common characteristics. Often good questions have specific titles that summarize the problem. An introduction to the problem comes before any code, explaining what the problem is, how it was encountered, any solutions attempted, and any difficulties found. Sometimes code isn't needed when asking a question, but code can often help clarify the situation. It's important to single out the problem in the code, and not include the entire program. Spelling and grammar mistakes may introduce confusion or invite ridicule, so remember to proofread. Well-articulated questions are easier to understand and thus easier to answer. A final tip is to always do some googling before posting a question.

          Bad questions do not properly convey the problem at hand, and are thus harder to answer and less likely to be answered. Some common characteristics of bad questions are essentialy the opposite of good questions: bad titles, incomplete context, and a lack of necessary examples or code. These characteristics make it difficult for others to understand and reproduce the problem, thus making it harder for them to pose a potential solution.

          In conclusion, the best questions are those that are easily understood, concise yet descriptive, and reproducible. One tip is to imagine you are trying to answer the question. Read your question with a fresh mind. Can you understand what you're asking? Can you reproduce the error? Does it make sense? And most importantly: are there any questions you need answered before providing a solution? Help yourself understand, and you will help others. Better questions lead to faster and more reliable answers. And, as always, thoroughly search for an answer first!
