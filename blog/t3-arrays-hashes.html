          Arrays and Hashes in Ruby

            Instead of working with one object, many times one wants to work with many objectsâ€“a <em>collection</em> of objects. Ruby represents collections of objects by putting them inside <em>container objects</em>. Two popular container objects are the array and the hash.
          </p>
          <p>
            An array is an ordered collection of objects. The objects are indexed numerically, starting from 0 and increasing by 1 as new objects are added to the array. In this way, an array acts as a list, starting the count at 0. Objects in the array can be accessed using the numerical index. The objects always stay in the same order unless one explicitly moves them around.
          </p>
          <p>
            A hash is also an ordered collection of objects. However, the objects are stored in pairs. Each pair consists of a key and a value, which can be any Ruby object (like a string). The values in the hash can be accessed using the keys. In this way, hashes act like lists, but instead of being numbered, each list item is prefixed with a unique key. There can be only one value for any given key. Hashes also remember the order in which key/value pairs were entered.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clearly, arrays and hashes are very similar. An array could be considered a hash, just with consecutive numbers representing the keys. And a hash could be considered an array, where the index can be anything, not just consecutive numbers. Arrays act as the staple of lists and collections. Hashes act as a more specialied list, allowing one to lookup values more easily.
