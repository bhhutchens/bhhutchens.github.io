          Stereotype Threat

            <em>Stereotype threat</em> is a phenomenon in which the threat of being viewed through the lens of a negative stereotype or the fear of doing something that would confirm that stereotype, negatively affects one's performance. The term was first coined by Steele and Aronson (1995), who demonstrated that when race was emphasized, black students performed more poorly on standardized tests compared to white students. When race was not emphasized, black students performed better and equivalently with white students. Anxiety about being judged and affirming a negative stereotype can seriously hinder performance on the task at hand. Any individual can suffer from stereotype threat when the situation invokes a stereotype-based expectation of poor performance.

            Reducing stereotype threat is thus important because it allow individuals to reach their full potential. One method for reducing stereotype threat is to reframe the task and use different language. Since sterotype threat arises in situations where task descriptions highlight social identities stereotypically associated with poor performance, reframing the issue in neutral terms can eliminate stereotype threat. Another method is to allow people to affirm their self-worth by thinking about their characteristics and roles they value as important. Doing so has been shown to reduce performance differences.

            When giving critical feedback on tasks that may involve potential stereotypes, another method is to communicate the high standards for performance but also assure the receiver that they are capable of meething those standards. Feedback that does this helps reduce perceived evaluator bias and thus sterotype threat.
          </p>

            It is also worth noting that a fixed view of intelligence (intelligence is set and cannot be improved) versus a growth view of intelligence (intelligence can be gained and honed over time) can affect the strength of stereotype threat on individuals. Research has shown that those with a fixed mindset are more susceptible to sterotype threat than those with a growth mindset. Individuals with a growth mindset tend to act more positively to challenges and are less likely to fear confirming negative sterotypes. Thus emphasizing a growth view of intelligence and ability can reduce sterotype threat.
