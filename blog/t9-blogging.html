          Reflecting on the Website

          Creating this website has been an extremeley enjoyable project. It is the first website I have created from scratch, using my own design and aesthetic, my own code and blog posts. At times it was challenging, but it was largely satisfying. And I never stopped learning, which was the best part of building this website and providing content.

          As far as things that I liked the most, I think transforming my conception of the website into actual code and a visible product was my favorite. Not only was it incredibly satisfying to be so creative and fulfilling to design a working product, but it was also challenging and pushed me to learn more and more. It was gratifying that my curiosity and desire to create a viable product drove me to learn and teach myself so much.

          What did I dislike? Not much. Even the hardships with errors that I encountered or the hours of research that I did were, in the end, worth it. I learned so much, and I cannot wait to continue posting more, evolving the website, and pushing myself to new levels.
