          Reflecting on My Thinking Style and Learning

            According to <a href=http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm>Gregorc</a>, I am an "abstract sequential" thinker. An abstract sequential (AS) thinker likes to make their point heard, analyze situations before making a decision, and applies logic in solving or finding solutions to problems. As such, AS thinkers learn best when they have access to experts/references, are placed in stimulating environments, and are able to work alone. Luckily at DBC, I will have great access to experts and will indeed be in a stimulating environment. I do think that having time to work alone is very important to me, so I wonder how I will be able to incorporate that at DBC–maybe just having to focus on topics offsite/after-hours by myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            AS thinkers have a difficult time being forced to work with those of differing views and also a difficult time being diplomatic when convincing others, which will be demanding in any environment (not just DBC), so working on acepting others' ideas will be a beneficial skill to work on. AS thinkers need time to deal with a subject thoroughly, which I believe is directly related to needing time to work alone. AS thinkers do not like repetitive tasks or lots of specific rules. Luckily, I do not think there will be much repetition at DBC. AS thinkers do have a hard time with "sentimental" thinking and expressing emotions, which I think will be one of the more challenging aspects of DBC. My hope is that Phase 0 will allow for a gradual process of getting to know everyone before diving in to the intensive on-site experience that will require more sentimentality.

            The biggest struggle for me so far has been the pair programming sessions. I find it really challenging to work through a challenge sort of <em>on the fly</em> with another person, so intimately. It's hard to admit weaknesses and vulnerabilities, as well as to be in a situation where I cannot always analyze it first before acting. I think <em>practice makes perfect</em> and, over time, I will become more comfortable with working with a partner without any context or moment of relief. It's an intense hour now, but in a month, hopefully it'll be second-nature.

            It can be relevant to talk about a <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">fixed vs. growth mindset</a>. I'm sure we're all making strides to be more of the growth mindset (intelligence can be developed) rather than the fixed mindset (intelligence is fixed) as this impacts our very performance. But looking at the difficulties AS thinkers have and reflecting on my biggest struggle to date makes me think that I need to personally reinforce the growth mindset. I need to be able to embrace challenges and persist against obstacles. I need to see all this effort I am putting in as a means to an end. I need to embrace criticism and learn from it. And hopefully with that effort and a little luck, this entire process won't force me to implode.
